# Design Patterns 
Personal project for different design patterns written in `TypeScript`.
I'm basing my work on the web portal [Refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/es/design-patterns).

## Install

```shell
npm install
```

## Testing
run command prompt:
```shell
npm test
```
The test coverage are located in the `index.html` file within the `Icov-report` folder.
